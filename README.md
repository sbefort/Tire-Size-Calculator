Tire Size Calculator
====================

This repository contains code for two calculators related to vehicle tire sizes.  A working demo of the project can be found at http://www.sizemytires.com/calculators.

<h2>Speedometer Calculator</h2>
Every vehicle has a stock tire size, otherwise known as OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer).  The factory adjusts the speedometer settings according to the stock size.  If you happen to change the OEM tire size, your speedometer may report inaccurate readings.

For example, if your stock tire size is 205/55R16, and you attempt to replace that with 245/55R16 (a very bad idea), your speedometer will read 70 when you are actually traveling at 75 MPH.  In addition to that, the overall diameter of your replacement tires will be significantly lower than the stock size, which could cause brake failure and other dangers.

Here is a <a href="http://www.sizemytires.com/calculators/speedometer">demo of the speedometer calculator</a>.

<h2>Metric / Inches Tire Size Calculator</h2>
Most passenger vehicles use a mixture of inches and millimeters in the tire code.  This is odd for obvious reasons.  Why would you use two separate measurement systems in the tire code?  I don't know the answer to that question or the history behind the madness.  Perhaps there is a good reason.

Anyway, in a typical tire coe like 245/55R16, there are three sets of numbers that have different meanings:

<ul>
  <li>245 - The tire width is 245 millimeters (metric)</li>
  <li>55 - The aspect ration is 55% of 245 (metric)</li>
  <li>16 - The rim size is 16 inches in diameter (imperial)</li>
</ul>

This tire size is considered to be a metric size even though it designates the rim to be 16 inches.

There is another tire size type that is all in inches.  This type is more commonly found on trucks and SUVs.  For example, one of the stock tire sizes for a 2003 Chevy Blazer LS ZR2 is 31x10.50R15.  The three numbers in this tire code mean the following:

<ul>
  <li>31 - The diameter is 31 inches (imperial)</li>
  <li>10.50 - The tire width is 10.50 inches (imperial)</li>
  <li>15 - The rim size is 15 inches (imperial)</li>
</ul>

Sometimes drivers want to know if they can replace imperial tires like those for the Chevy with a metric tire size (or vice versa).  The <a href="http://www.sizemytires.com/calculators/metric-inches">metric - inches calculator</a> can help drivers find a compatible tire size.
